; modified in several significant ways
; 1) Literal strings are replaced with numbers and ranges (%d32 & %d32-126, etc.) when possible.
;    TRB and especially TRG operators are much more efficient than TLS operators.
; 2) Two rules, authority and URI, are used multiple times in different contexts. These rules will be reproduced and renamed
;    in order to a) recognize the context and b) remove unneccary callback functions for certain contexts.
;    This will simiplify recognizing contexts AND remove unneccesary callbacks
; 2.a) domain is defined as authority-d which is identical to authority except that there will be no
;      callback functions defined on authority-d or any of its *-d components.
; 2.b) The resource URI is defined as URI-r and its components defined as *-r.
;      In this way, callback functions can be defined on URI and is components while
;      leaving URI-r to be parsed identically with no unnecessary callback functions to slow it down.
; 3) IPv6address does not work because of APG's "first-success disambiguation" and "greedy" repetitions.
;    IPv6address redefined and validations moved to callback functions (semantic vs syntactic validation)
;    Redefinition requires negative look-ahead operators, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_predicate
;    That is SABNF instead of simple ABNF.
; 4) IPv4address fails because of "first-success disambiguation".
;    This could be fixed with rearrangement of the alternative terms. However, it would still not
;    accept zero-padded (leading zeros) decimal octets.
;    Therefore, IPv4address is also done with callback functions and semantic validation.
; 5) The negative look-ahead operator is also needed in the definition of host to
;    prevent failure with a reg-name that begins with an IPv4 address.
; 6) NOTE: host = 1.1.1.256 is a valid host name even though it is an invalid IPv4address.
;          The IPv4address alternative fails but the reg-name alternative succeeds.

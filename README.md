Sign-In with Ethereum describes how Ethereum accounts authenticate with 
off-chain services by signing a standard message format parameterized by scope,
session details, and security mechanisms (e.g., a nonce). The goals of this 
specification are to provide a self-custodied alternative to centralized 
identity providers, improve interoperability across off-chain services for 
Ethereum-based authentication, and provide wallet vendors a consistent 
machine-readable message format to achieve improved user experiences and 
consent management.

## [Quickstart Example](./examples/notepad)
To try it out locally, there is an example that uses Sign-In With Ethereum to
create a notepad that persists to a server after a user authenticates with
their Ethereum address.

To use the example, run the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/spruceid/siwe
cd siwe/examples/notepad
npm install
npm run dev
```

See the example README.md for more details.

## Motivation
When signing in to popular non-blockchain services today, users will typically 
use identity providers (IdPs) that are centralized entities with ultimate 
control over users' identifiers, for example, large internet companies and email
providers. Incentives are often misaligned between these parties. Sign-In with
Ethereum offers a new self-custodial option for users who wish to assume more
control and responsibility over their own digital identity.

Already, many services support workflows to authenticate Ethereum accounts using
message signing, such as to establish a cookie-based web session which can 
manage privileged metadata about the authenticating address. This is an 
opportunity to standardize the sign-in workflow and improve interoperability 
across existing services, while also providing wallet vendors a reliable method 
to identify signing requests as Sign-In with Ethereum requests for improved UX.

This work is sponsored by the Ethereum Foundation and Ethereum Name Service 
(ENS). It is being developed in the open through a series of recorded community 
calls and public repositories, and its development is informed by over twenty 
user interviews with a focus on currently-in-production uses, related prior 
EIPs, and fits within product roadmaps.

## Sign-In with Ethereum Buttons

For those incorporating Sign-In with Ethereum into their project and require a button for users, we have included two as part of this asset set, covering both a light and dark background:

These buttons have also been made into Figma components and can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1047625951123719630).

Some additional creative designs have been provided by `Cousin Eddie#5625` in the Spruce Discord server with confirmation of a CC0 waiver. Those examples can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/UUqhgK03wwVxiKjzw90Nuh/Sign-In-With-Ethereum---Button-Designs?node-id=0%3A1).
